From Hookaido to Okinawa, from earthquake-hit regions like Noto, to lively city Tokyo, Free Palestine movement in Japan is unique, but not any different, because we are all humans. from students, to doctors, artists, activists, people from all walks of life are raising their voices every single day since the genocide started.<br/>

But pro-Palestine activism is not new. Activsts have been standing up in resistance for Palesine for decades. The world has never seen a genocide live-streamed on their smartphones before, or media bias of this scale. It is a shock for many people.  Palestinian resilience has everyone something. Volunteers who have been to Gaza and the West Bank, are now actvists, crying for Palestine in their speeches. Books like "Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine パレスチナの民族浄化" has been translated into Japanese.
